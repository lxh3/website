<h1>About Me</h1>

I am a Doctoral student in the group of James Sethna at Cornell University. I was born and raised in Ashland, Missouri and completed my undergraduate study at the University of Missouri - Columbia. 
<br><br>
My past projects include studies of Magnetism and Spin effects. More recently I have studied the model manifold of Deep Sigmoidal Networks and applications of Machine Learning (ML) to Stock Data. 
<br><br>
Currently, I am working on applying ideas from dynamical systems theory to the Renormalization Group for the Non-Equilibrium Random Field Ising Model.
